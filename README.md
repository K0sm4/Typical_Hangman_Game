# Typical Hangman Game 

This is a simple Hangman Game project written in Python. The player's objective is to guess a random word by providing one letter at a time. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn on the screen, indicating the progress and outcome of the game.

## How 2 Play:

Run the Python script hangman.py.

The game will display underscores representing the letters of the word to guess.

Enter a letter as your guess and press Enter.

If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the appropriate position(s).

If the letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman will be drawn on the screen.

Keep guessing until you either guess the word correctly or the hangman is fully drawn.

Enjoy the game and have fun!
